# Actomyosin-Only-Model
This repository contains Matlab files for Actomyosin Only Model corresponding
to my paper-"Emergence of a smooth interface from growth of a dendritic network against a mechanosensitive contractile material"

This model reconstitutes the contractile actomyosin network. The model was verified by comparing the qualitative features of contraction profile with published in vitro work.
