# Actomyosin-Only-Model
This repository contains Matlab files for Actomyosin Only Model corresponding
to my paper-"Emergence of a smooth interface from growth of a dendritic network against a mechanosensitive contractile material"

This code reconstitute Arp 2/3 actin cap mimicing the growth of actin cap as seen in early development of Drosophila embryo during the syncytial stage.
